;Here we place an .ini-format config file
;The general format is:

;[object1_name]
;name1 = val1
;name2 = val2

;[object2_name]
;serial_debug_enabled = true
;pin = 7
;ip = 192.168.1.1
;subdevice_list = child1_name,child2_name
;etcetera etcetera

;I would like to use YML or some other format, but I haven't found a library I like yet.
;ini works for now:
; - it has section breaks
; - it allows comments
; - the library for it is very good.

[demo_machine]
enable_serial_debug = true
subdevice_names = digital_input1,digital_output1


;We don't specify pin directions on digital_input/digital_output
;because the direction is in the name, and it's hardcoded.

;Hook-up a button on GPIO26 (D3 on the Firebeetle ESP32)
;Because it is initialised from a parent device (demo_device) we include the device_type field.
[digital_input1]
device_type = digital_input
enable_serial_debug = true
pin = 26

;LED_BUILTIN == GPIO2 on Firebeetle ESP32
;Because it is initialised from a parent device (demo_device) we include the device_type field.
[digital_output1]
device_type = digital_output
enable_serial_debug = true
pin = 2
