;Here we place an .ini-format config file
;The general format is:

;[object1_name]
;name1 = val1
;name2 = val2

;[object2_name]
;enable_serial_debug = true
;pin = 7
;ip = 192.168.1.1
;subdevice_list = child1_name,child2_name
;etcetera etcetera

;I would like to use YML or some other format, but I haven't found a library I like yet.
;ini works for now:
; - it has section breaks
; - it allows comments

;For this test, use a DuPont wire to connect IO8 to 3V3. 
;Connecting it should turn on the builtin LED. 
;Disconnecting it should turn the LED off

;For my PCB the built-in LED is pin 2
[digital_output1]
pin = 2
enable_serial_debug = false

;Feel free to use another pin, this one was chosen arbitrarily.
[digital_input1]
pin = 5
enable_serial_debug = false
